**Instructor:** Dr. Veronika Ročková

**Teammate**: Victoria He

**Project Type:** Academic Project 

**Programming Language:** Python, R 

**Keywords:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, PCA, LASSO, Dimension Reduction for Large-Scale Datasets, 
Model Evaluation and Comparison, Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Applied Machine Learning Models. 

This repository contains data, code, and report files related to an academic project I completed with my teammate Victoria He 
between March and June, 2022, at the University of Chicago; 

With online shopping being a crucial part of our daily lives, one important question that all online-shopping platforms ask repeatedly is 
"What are the main factors that make a customer decide to make a purchase?". In an attempt to scratch the sruface of this complicated question, 
we gathered a dataset that records onliner shopper's user behaviors and applied various classification ML models. 

This project contains the typical components of a data analysis research question with ML models implemented: **EDA, model selection, model evaluation, model results.**

In this repository, you will find the following supporting documents: 
1. The formal project report detailing every step of our analysis;
2. The raw data, "online_shoppers_intention.csv";
3. The source code (R) that implemented every step of our project;
4. A source code (R) that implemented our Naive Bayes model with a Gaussian prior;
5. Two png files that visualizes our model results with and without dimension reduction measures.
